The Log Analysis Script is a Python-based tool designed to parse and analyze web server log files. It extracts valuable insights, including:

The number of requests made by each IP address.
The most frequently accessed endpoint.
Suspicious activities such as potential brute force login attempts.
The results are displayed in the terminal and saved to a structured CSV file for further review.
